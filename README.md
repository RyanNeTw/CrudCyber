### CyberSec

- `SQL injections`, `CSRF attacks`, and `DDoS attacks` are handled by Symfony. This management capability offers robust protection against these common web security threats. Symfony provides specific tools and components to secure applications against these vulnerabilities. By integrating these security measures, Symfony helps to prevent the execution of malicious code, session hijacking, and denial-of-service attacks. Thus, developers can focus on building features while maintaining a high level of security.

- `XSS attacks` (Cross-Site Scripting) occur when attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. In Symfony projects, one way to mitigate such attacks is by implementing slugs for dynamic data, such as URLs, to ensure that only safe and expected input is rendered on the client side. This practice helps to prevent the execution of malicious scripts by avoiding the direct use of user input in rendering without validation or encoding.
